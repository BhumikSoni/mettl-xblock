About Mettl
-----------

Mettl provides advanced proctoring, **Mettl Advanced Proctoring** is a step up from our current Web and Image proctoring features. For those who aren’t familiar with our Web and Image proctoring – Web Proctor Feature defines a top limit for the number of times the candidate can navigate away from their test screen and also pops a warning or terminates the test depending on the admin set limit. Image Proctor feature activates the candidate’s webcam and takes random shots of the candidate in the duration of the test – these get appended in the automatically generated report. With the introduction of the Advanced Web and Advanced Image Proctoring Features, the test admin will be able to do all of the above AND get the live feed on the candidate’s progress on the test, live – With webcam feed in case of Advanced Image Proctoring and an image free, candidate-wise test progress. With the Advanced Proctor feature, the test admin can see all the candidates in a grid view on the dashboard (See image below) and do all of the following:

 - Can watch the live feed of the candidate
 - Get live images of candidates updates every few seconds
 - Chat with the candidate
 - Make announcements
 - See automatically generated red flags (Flagged by our SW depending on any suspicious behavior)
 - Pull up live feed of any candidate with history at any stage in the test
 - Terminate any test from the dashboard
 - View the candidate’s screen – live!
